<h1> Sel's Vans </h1>

This project is my first attempt at building something big using React-Router-Dom,
this project was very educational, I focus on the front end, making the app 
look as elegant and as realistic as possible. It is a van renting website. 

Features: 
1. The app is able to filter through the vans, classing them by "style"
2. There is a Host section that shows a beautiful dashboard section
3. Utilized tools like NavLink to make the selection section stays highlighted
4. Litte celebration when the user rents a van via the vans section.
